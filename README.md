Little Sail is just an extension for [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail). Currently, the Laravel Sail PHP image is over ~666mb. This is mostly because it uses the Ubuntu image. For those who would prefer smaller images, I created this extension.

The image generated by this package is around ~284mb. Thats around a **57% decrease** in size.

It is a similar image with the same extensions but built using a [Linux Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) base.

## Installation
To install, use composer to pull the package:

```shell
composer require neo/little-sail --dev
```

Next, update your projects `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
    api:
        build:
            context: ./vendor/laravel/sail/runtimes/8.0      # Replace this
            context: ./vendor/neo/little-sail/runtimes/8.0   # With this
# ...
```

If you already had Laravel Sail running, you will have to stop the containers, and then delete the `sail-8.0/app` image and then run `sail up` again (you can also just change the image name in your `docker-compose.yml` file).

You can use the nifty command included with the package:

```shell
$ ./vendor/bin/dock
```

Then when the command is done running, you can bring Laravel Sail up again.
